          CONSUMPTION of ALCOHOL in the UNITED STATES <i>(1977-2016)</i>

          Alcohol was introduced to America as early as the
          <b>early 1600s</b> when settlers from England brought supplies of
          beer. Its first brewery was constructed in New Amsterdam, which would
          later <b>become known as New York City</b>. George Washington himself,
          the USA's first President, wrote a recipe titled
          <b>"To make Small Beer"</b>. Beer continues to have a lasting impact
          on the country's society, and we will analyse the data trends on its
          consumption from 1977 to 2016.

          <p class="subtitle2">
            One of <b>four states with no sales tax</b>, New Hampshire has
            always had one of the highest alcohol "consumptions" (in reality, it
            should be sales) in the states. From 1977 it rose from the
            <b>3rd highest alcohol consumption to the 1st place in 2016.</b>
            <br /><br />
            Between 1918 and 1933, Alaska held in place a <b>'bone dry law'</b>,
            prohibiting the manufacture and sale of alcohol. Though the law is
            now out of effect, this hasn't prevented it from being one of the
            country's highest alcohol consumers, where it has steadily remained
            in the <b>top 10 consumers from 1977 to 2016.</b>
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="hcontainer">
          <p class="subtitle2">
            Utah's position as the lowest or second-lowest rank has cemented
            itself as the state with the <b>lowest alcohol consumer amongst all the
            United States</b>. It owes this position to decades of strict alcohol
            laws as well as other factors, such as that a substantial proportion
            of the state's population is <b>Mormon, a religion which forbids
            alcohol consumption.</b>

            The above chart shows state comparisons of alcohol consumption
            between 1977 and 2016, ignoring the years in between. Through this,
            it displays very simply a state's progression and its difference
            from then and now.
            <br /><br />
            Nevada has had the <b>most dramatic drop</b> in alcohol consumption,
            reducing its consumption by 2.86 from 1977 to 2016. Though not as
            dramatic as a progression, Delaware is one of the few states with an
            rise in alcohol consumption, <b>rising 0.86 from 1977 to 2016.</b>
          </p>
          <p class="subtitle3">
            The below map shows alcohol consumption by state between 1977 and
            2016. Through this, we can see whether alcohol consumption is
            correlated to regional differences (e.g. east-coast versus
            west-coast), as well as identify outliers across regions (such as
            Nevada and Utah).
            <br /><br />
            The map is <b>considerably lighter in the earliest years</b>, but this is
            due to the max drinks consumed (per capita) affecting the legend,
            causing the majority of states to lighten in saturation.

          <p class="subtitle2">
            In the chart above we are able to identify that the <b>most popular
            alcoholic beverage of consumption is beer</b>, followed by spirits, then
            lastly wine. Though the gap between beer and spirits is not too
            small in 2016 (1.15 versus 0.93), beer has always had a history as
            the most popular beverage. The intermediate years between 1977 and
            2016 show a much wider gap between beer and the other alcohol types.
            It is interesting to see that throughout the years, <b>the ranking of
            these alcohol types have never changed.</b>
            <br /><br />
            On the Alcohol Consumption Scatterplot, we see that the outliers in
            terms of state consumption are <b>Nevada, District of Columbia, and New
            Hampshire (with exceptionally higher alcohol consumptions) and Utah
            (with exceptionally lower alcohol consumption)</b>. The black line
            represents the average across all states.

          <p class="subtitle3">
            The Alcohol Type Consumption by Percentage chart shows once again
            how dominant beer is as a preference for alcohol consumption. It has
            taken up more than <b>half the market share across a majority of the
            years</b> between 1977 and 2016.
          </p>
          <p class="subtitle3">
            A brief insight into the USA's alcohol consumption shows <b>states have
            vastly different attitudes towards drinking</b>. Many factors influence
            these attitudes and statistics, whether it be strict alcohol laws
            such as in Utah, or lax sales tax such as in New Hampshire. Despite
            being a united country, there is <b>certainly a cultural divide in
            America's states</b>, identifiable in alcohol consumption.
